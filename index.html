                <p>Oggy and the Cockroaches (French: Oggy et les Cafards) is a French comedy animated television series
                    produced by Gaumont Multimedia (first two seasons) and Xilam Animation (third season onwards), and
                    created by Jean-Yves Raimbaud, co-creator of Space Goofs, who died during production of Oggy's first

                    vocalizations and gestures. The show premiered in September 1998 on France 3, and later expanded
                    internationally.</p>
